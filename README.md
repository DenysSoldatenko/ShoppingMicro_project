# SpringMicro_project
**SpringMicro_project** is my exploration into the exciting world of microservices architecture. It's a hands-on learning experience built with powerful tools like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

### **What I'm learning:**
- **Microservices 101:** Understanding the core concepts and advantages of microservices compared to monolithic and SOA architectures.
- **Spring Boot Mastery:** Mastering Spring Boot's efficiency to build, configure, and test microservices with ease.
- **Spring Cloud Prowess:** Unlocking the power of Spring Cloud features like Eureka for service discovery, Config Server for centralized configuration, Resilience4J for fault tolerance, and Gateway for API routing.

### **Project Structure:**
I've organized the project into modular components, each dedicated to a specific microservice or technology:
- **cloud-gateway:** The entry point for API access, managing requests and routing them to the appropriate services.
- **config-server:** My central hub for configuration management, ensuring consistency across all microservices.
- **eureka-server:** The service registry, enabling microservices to discover and interact with each other.
- **order-service:** Handles order creation, processing, and fulfillment.
- **payment-service:** Ensures secure and reliable payment processing.
- **product-service:** Provides product information and inventory management.
